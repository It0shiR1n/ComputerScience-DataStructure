### CPU 

![alt text](/images/cpu.png)

the CPU is the brain of the computer, with him we can execute programas normally without dificultty, he have a instructions set
that is operations utilized to take actions inside and execute the programs with this also another thing that is cool is the CPU branching.

internally we have 3 components
    - Controller (Scheluding and management of the process and resources)
    - ULA (Executes operations)
    - Cache Memory (Memory that useful to store operands)


### Instructions Set

- Instructions Type
    - **Load/Put data from memory**
    - **Bit operations (XOR, AND, OR, NOT) and Math operations (sin, cos, square root)**


### CPU Cycle 

- MHz/s = 1.000.000      | - Unit cycle measure com CPU
- GHz/s = 1.000.000.000  |


In a really simple example without pipeline we will need 4Hz to execute a complete operations of 
Fetch, Decode, Execute and Store in one second.
